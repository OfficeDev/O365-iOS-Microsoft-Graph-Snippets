# [ARCHIVED] Office 365 iOS Microsoft Graph Snippets

This project is being archived. As part of the archival process, we're closing all open issues and pull requests. For a current Objective-C sample, see [ios-objectivec-connect-sample](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/ios-objectivec-connect-sample).

You can continue to use this sample "as-is", but it won't be maintained moving forward. We apologize for any inconvenience.

## Introduction

Microsoft Graph (previously called Office 365 unified API) exposes multiple APIs from Microsoft cloud services through a single REST API endpoint. This repository shows you how to access multiple resources, including Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD) and the Office 365 APIs, by making HTTP requests to the Microsoft Graph API in an iOS application. 

 
## Prerequisites
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) from Apple
* Installation of [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html)  as a dependency manager.
* An Office 365 account. You can sign up for [an Office 365 Developer subscription](https://aka.ms/devprogramsignup) that includes the resources that you need to start building Office 365 apps.

     > Note: If you already have a subscription, the previous link sends you to a page with the message *Sorry, you canâ€™t add that to your current account*. In that case, use an account from your current Office 365 subscription.
* A Microsoft Azure tenant to register your application. Azure AD provides identity services that applications use for authentication and authorization. A trial subscription can be acquired here: [Microsoft Azure](https://account.windowsazure.com/SignUp).

     > Important: You will also need to ensure your Azure subscription is bound to your Office 365 tenant. To do this see the Active Directory team's blog post, [Creating and Managing Multiple Windows Azure Active Directories](http://blogs.technet.com/b/ad/archive/2013/11/08/creating-and-managing-multiple-windows-azure-active-directories.aspx). The section **Adding a new directory** will explain how to do this. You can also see [Set up your Office 365 development environment](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/howto/setup-development-environment#bk_CreateAzureSubscription) and the section **Associate your Office 365 account with Azure AD to create and manage apps** for more information.
      
* * A client id (application id) and redirect uri values of an application registered in Azure. This sample application must be granted several permissions for **Microsoft Graph**. To create the registration, see [Grant permissions to the Snippets application in Azure](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/ios-objectivec-snippets-rest-sample/wiki/Grant-permissions-to-the-Snippets-application-in-Azure).


## Running this sample in Xcode

1. Clone this repository
2. Use CocoaPods to import the necessary dependencies:
        
	     pod 'AFNetworking', '2.6.0'
	     pod 'ADALiOS', '1.2.4'

	This sample app already contains a podfile that will get the necessary components(pods) into  the project. Simply navigate to the project from **Terminal** and run 
        
        pod install
        
   	For more information, see **Using CocoaPods** in [Additional Resources](#AdditionalResources)
  
3. Open **O365-iOS-Microsoft-Graph-Snippets.xcworkspace**
4. Open **ConnectViewController.m** under the **Controllers** folder in the project. Ensure you have registered your app in Microsoft Azure, configured the proper permissions as specified, and obtained the **ClientID** (application id) and **RedirectUri** values from the registration. Again, this procedure is detailed under the fifth bullet point in the prerequisites section: **A client id and redirect uri values of an application registered in Azure.** You'll see that the **ClientID** and **RedirectUri** values can be added to the top of the file. Supply the necessary values here:

        // You will set your application's clientId and redirect URI. You get
        // these when you register your application in Microsoft Azure.
        NSString * const kRedirectUri = @"ENTER_REDIRECT_URI_HERE";
        NSString * const kClientId    = @"ENTER_CLIENT_ID_HERE";
        NSString * const kResourceId  = @"https://graph.microsoft.com";
        NSString * const kAuthority   = @"https://login.microsoftonline.com/common";
